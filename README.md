# Script for splicing sections out of an alignment
Particuarly useful for removing parasitic elements or insertions from an alignment so both the invaded allele and the insertion can be analyzed seperately.

Usage: perl splice_alignment.pl START_CUT END_CUT

Note: If you want to splice a section from the start of your alignment, use 0  as your start_cut.
